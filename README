starling and simplified_starling plugin

the model required fields are

create_table "art_works", :force => true do |t|
 t.string   "image",          :limit => 200,      :default => "",    :null => false

Example
=======

to use this , in your model do :


class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base

acts_as_uploadable  :content_type => ['application/pdf','image/jpeg', 'image/pjpeg', 'image/gif', 'image/png', 'image/x-png', 'image/jpg'],    :s3_bucket => 'artenlinea' , :path=>"art_works" ,
:thumbnails => {:options=>[
  {:type=>'resize_to_width',:size=>550,:name=>'resize'},
  {:type=>'cropped_thumbnail',:size=>100,:name=>'thumb'}
  ]}
....
....
end

if you dont need to check for the file in creation include this attribute option  

:file_needed_on_create=>0,
  



/**********************************************************************/
i added in_s3 field to check if the file is in filesystem or in s3 .
when you update a image the old file name keeps in old_filename and the new one is in image field, the old one y deleted from s3 in a starling process.

when you create a image , first it copies to file system, and, in background, it sends to starling the s3 upload to make the upload process faster , 

when the file is on s3 the local copies are deleted, this happens in update and create methods

if the file is in local file system, the view helper links to local file , otherwise it look for s3 file when in_s3 == true

Todo:

a template for a form and a js upload_progress bar (css , js)

create a method to check if there is a s3 connection in the case the s3 service is down,

integrate a ActionView::Helpers::Number into the plugin

delete the old s3 file during the update
create a methos to check if there is a s3 connection in the case the s3 service is down,
create a strategy to cache the file if that happends (not eliminate de local copies), create a new field "in_s3" or something like that
#create un method in_s3? and ,send_to_cron
